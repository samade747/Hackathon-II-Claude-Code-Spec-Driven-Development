# Todo App Constitution

## Core Principles
1. **Simplicity First**: Start with minimal viable features.
2. **User-Centric**: All interactions must be intuitive.
3. **Data Integrity**: Never lose user data during a session.
4. **Extensibility**: Design for future AI integration and Phase II.

## Development Standards
- Use Python 3.11+ and type hints in all Python code.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- All public functions and classes must have docstrings.
- Input validation on all user entries.
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages.
- Tests via `pytest` with deterministic behaviour (mock time where needed).

## Data Model Principles
- Each task has a unique ID (UUID4 string).
- Timestamps for creation and updates (`created_at`, `modified_at` in ISO 8601 UTC).
- Support for flexible metadata: `priority`, `tags`, and optional `due_date`.

## Success Criteria (Phase I)
- All acceptance tests in `spec/test-cases.md` pass under `pytest`.
- Code is generated by Claude Code from `constitution/`, `spec/`, `tasks/` artifacts (no handwritten production logic).
- A `README.md` demonstrates how to run CLI and tests.
